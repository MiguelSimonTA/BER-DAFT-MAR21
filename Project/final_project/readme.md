# Your final bootcamp project 


Purpose
The aim of the final bootcamp project is for students to conceive, complete and present an end to end data 'product', to put their newly acquired skills into practice. The final project topic/research question is to be scoped by each student, with support from the teaching staff, who will share past examples of successful student projects with you, as well as concept briefs that you can select or adapt (for any student who does not have a firm topic idea).

The ideal scope of a final project is one that represents enough of a challenge to each student to acquire and stretch the depth of technical skills, on top of applying what they have already learnt, therefore they are pushed to extend their capabilities and refine the understanding of the different areas of Data Analysis. At the same time, the intention is NOT to provoke frustration or generate so much of a challenge that the student is either unable to finish the project in the time or unable to demonstrate their soft skills, such as presenting at the end to a non technical audience. 

Timeline
Turn in all deliverables and meet all requirements by the end of Unit 9

Retro planning
To be able to make the most out of your final project week, you need to start preparing in advance. We tend to underestimate the amount of time we ought to put into:

Reflecting whats interesting, inspiring and challenging for us
Defining the sequence of steps to follow to get to destination (set up your final project)
Therefore, it’s best if you start working on your own from the end of Unit 7 on. Here’s a proposed schedule:

1. Preparation
:clock10: Unit 7

End of week 7: start thinking about the project, brain storm and initially research a data question / topic or challenge that you would like to solve, keeping in mind what is going to be achievable for you within the timeframe and considering also which skills / topics from the course so far you want to utilise. 

:clock10: Unit 8

Around the middle of unit 8: Having firmed up your research question, your hypothesis and planned method, as well as identifying (TIP: also testing...) your data source, present your business problem to the teaching staff as an “Elevator Pitch”  - a 2 minute presentation of the idea, where the data comes from and what challenges you envisage. The teaching team will give you feedback on how realistic the project is and any useful tips you might not have considered. 

By the end of unit 8 Plan and organise your project road map, your kanban board and identify the sub tasks which make up the project whole, submit your final project proposal via the student portal and start the project. 

2. Workflow
:clock10: Unit 8-9

3. Presentation
:clock10: Unit 9

By the end of Unit 9: Get selected and present your project in an open event!

Learning Objectives:
After this project, students will be able to:

Scope and manage a full data analysis project
Look for interesting challenges to solve using available data analysis methods
Adapt mature analytical techniques to dealing with a chosen data source (must include at least one of : advanced data cleaning/processing, web scraping, machine learning or statistics) 
Identify the best approach to solve a business/ social research question using data analytics skills taught during the course
Select from and know how to apply algorithms, inferential statistics, appropriate to the identified data question(s) which could lead to wider and relevant insights of a research question 
Use Tableau at an intermediate level to visualise insights from the existing data or enhance your presentation by utilising Tableau to visualise the processing / results stages of a project
Present your work as if to a non technical audience - the two best data presentations will be peer selected to appear alongside the two best from UX/UI and Web, during Friday's Hackathon, which is a public attended event.

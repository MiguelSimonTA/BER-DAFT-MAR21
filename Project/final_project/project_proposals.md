### Here are some final project proposals for anyone who doesnt have a firm project in mind - feel free to adopt one of these or adapt it to your own preferences 

+ Our class slack workspace- json wrangling, insights, and links posted from the start of the course - it is possible to download the full json code from the beginning of the course - could you build a reusable python tool which would allow any ironhack class to pull the useful (and gdpr compliant) information from their slack workspace data - and pitch it to the ironhack bosses ? for example shared web resources, the most active channels, topics, threads and emojis

### Here are some final project proposals for anyone who doesnt have a firm project in mind - feel free to adopt one of these or adapt it to your own preferences 

+ Our class slack workspace- json wrangling, insights, and links posted from the start of the course - can you build a reusable python tool which would allow all ironhack classes to pull useful (and gdpr compliant) information from their slack workspace data - and pitch it to the ironhack bosses ? 
+ air pollution levels in cities- comparative analysis paris/ london  - trends and identifying specific places/times to avoid - can city dwellers make simple lifestyle changes to lower their levels of exposure to harmful air pollutants?
+ hospital admissions and care interventions - do specific care client interventions for the elderly contribute to lower levels of emergency admissions ? (not including covid-19)

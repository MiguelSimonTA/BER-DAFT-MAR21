# Lab | Tableau Guided Analysis with Stories

Build a story compiled of individual captioned storypoints in Tableau and publish the story only to your tableau public account, in order to submit the url via the Student Portal. 

Utilise the annotation and duplicate storypoint features within the Story which will guide the end user through the story you want to tell with your data.  For each page of your story you should consider data visualisation best practices. 

Reminder : we are looking for individual views or charts on each task, not dashboards. 

## Challenge 1 

Using the data set [Harvested_Crops_Summary.csv](Harvested_Crops_Summary.csv) 
and Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public, create a story (at least 6 story points, but you can add more!) to take end users through the following or a similar / customised narrative: 

The chart choices for each story point are up to you and be as simple or complex as you like but remember the story is ideally consumed as a semi interactive presentation or pdf
(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, mark type, title, axis labels and legend.) 

1 overall summary / introduction to the story
2 a view containing a sample of the data used and the detail/granularity inside the data set
3 a view of crops and location to provide context for what the analysis will cover
4 some vizzes showing comparisons between the available measures - pick at least 1 relationship to drill into by crop and country 
  for example : 
  - yield in tonnes(you can derive this from HG/HA) compared to area harvested
  - gross production in tonnes v gross production in value) 
5 any outliers, points of note or suprising trends you want to draw attention to with your story? 
6 what do you want the end user to remember about your story (conclusion / main findings)



This dataset for this lab is taken from a makeover monday challenge earlier this month (14.03) which means you will find lots of examples online via twitter and tableau public of tableau workbooks that other commnunity users have built, as well as videos on the top examples and a viz along video too. 
A lot of what you might discover may be advanced for you but will give ou some ideas for what your story could contain.

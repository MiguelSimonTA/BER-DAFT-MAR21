# Lab | Tableau Charts - Simply answering questions with charts

Build the following charts in tableau and publish them to your tableau public account (or upload the charts to your github repo as images in a readme) in order to submit the url via the Student Portal. Each task requires you to build a single tableau visualisation which enables the end user to easily answer the question. For each chart consider data visualisation best practices in your use of colour, text, axis labels and headings, legends, size/fit. We are looking for individual views or charts, not dashboards. 

## Challenge 1 

Using the data set [profitability.xlsx](profitability.xlsx) 
and Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public, create the following charts to visualise and answer the following simple questions: 

(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, mark type, title, axis labels and legend.) 

1) Which company made the most per second in 2016? and Which industry was that in? Which industry appears most often in the top 5? suggestion - use a horizontal bar plot
2) Is there any discernible relationship between the Fortune 500 Rank of a company and its Net profit per year in 2016? suggestion -Use a scatter plot
3) In our data set, what does the breakdown of no of companies per industry look like? suggestion - Use a text table, packed bubble or treemap to display this
5) Add a url action on the menu select to go from any of these charts to https://fortune.com/company/<Company> using the selected company name

## Challenge 2 

Using the data set [laureate.csv](laureate.csv) 
and Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public, create the following charts to visualise and answer the following simple questions: 

(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, mark type, title, axis labels/legend or map layers.) 

1) Which country has produced the most nobel laureates up to 2016 (country of birth)? suggestion -Use a map
2) Whats the % of male to female nobel laureates up to 2016? suggestion -Use a text table or pie chart
3) How many award motivations can we find in our data set that cite analysis work? (use 'analy' with CONTAINS to look for either analysis or analyses, analyze) suggestion -Use a bar chart
4) For those laureates we do know the City they lived in at the time of the award, what difference do you notice about the location of physics and medicine nobel prize winners compared to chemistry? Use a stacked bar chart and experiement with the sort order to discover this insight- or display the 3 bar charts next to eachother in one view and use the sort icon on the axis to explore the data.

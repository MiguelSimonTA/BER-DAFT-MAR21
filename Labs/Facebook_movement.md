Method: Work collaboratively in groups of 2-4 

Time: you have until 4pm today to get the data, analyse it, and develop a story around it which can be presented back to the classroom

Tools :  Tableau (with support from Python as needed)

Introduction: There must have been times during the past year that you have felt like you were living in a dystopian novel or had accidentally auditioned for a surrealist play, where faceless government agencies and an giant spiky virus were making decisions about your personal/ professional life and your freedom of movement. It would be silly for us to complete a data analyst course in this year without giving some attention to covid-19, but we will approach it as analysts - start with raw data, then add in our emotions and personal experience to shape it into a data story. You will be working with a database that facebook has gathered and shared for public non-commercial use - when you can, give some thought to the reliability and quality of the data source, and what portion of the population is going to be unavoidably excluded from this data. Despite my antipathy towards facebook, its the best raw data source I found to start you off on this project. Of course, the internet is full of a thousand other covid related data sources - but be careful not to go too far down the alice in wonderland tunnel and forget the time. We have seen it happen.  

Objective in more detail: 
- Collaborate and support each-other, sharing your ideas, brainstorming what is the story you want to tell and making the most of each of your respective skills to produce a **data story** centred around changes observed in human movement under covid-19 restrictions in specific country(/ies) or Region(s). 
- There must have been times during the past year that youve felt like you were living in a dystopian novel or had accidentally auditioned for a surreal play. 
Your story should be enhanced with research and data points/ background knowledge from other sources that will enhance your data story. Your presentation must take your audience on a journey through the arc of your data story - hint: think about who your story would be targeted at, in order to pitch the visuals, language, descriptions, and technical details appropriately. This link is a good one to get you thinking as a storyteller about story arcs and the elements of a plot. Your data source(s) can be processed /cleaned, explored in Python or Tableau, but the end output should be in Tableau as a dashboard or story.

Resources : 

We are giving you one open data source to work with - other elements of your story can be drawn from 'data' sources you find online or simply taken from your own research - ie key dates and changes in public policy, or issues you are familiar with, opinion pieces you find, news articles etc. https://data.humdata.org/dataset/movement-range-maps 
Guidance / Tips :

Start with drafting a story - think about zooming in to the major story and identifying an interesting focus story or side story. 
introduction-visual-insight-conclusion - can be a good simple structure
Dont try to do too much - think about comparing 2 or 3 places, spotting patterns and variation, rather than looking at lots of places and looking for multi-vector trends
Use what you know - if you already have an opinion about a trend, see if the data backs you up, that could give you a head start!
Deadline is 4:30 PM today so there is a little time pressure to come up with a story, identify additional data points or sources, bring it together and visualise it inside Tableau. At the end of the day (from 4:45 onwards) you will be sharing your story with the whole class. Important! this is not a formal / polished presentation- you simply nominate one person in your team to click through and demonstrate your group's story on the zoom classroom.

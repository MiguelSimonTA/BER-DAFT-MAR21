## NLP Lab 

This lab has been designed to be completed at either **Starter level** or **Stretch level** - in order to accomodate different technical / time / motivation levels in the class. **Starter** - is the minimum required deliverable for today's lab, so you should complete the steps below as directed before submitting the url to your notebook via the student portal. **Stretch** will take you longer and the actions you will take are prompted, rather than prescriptive.  

You will follow the instructions and concepts you saw in class today to:
+ retrieve the data 
+ sample a few customer reviews using textblob
+ use a function, for loop or dictionary comprehension to apply sentiment analysis to the whole data set
+ visualise the sentiment by department / division
*(optional- Stretch)*
+ visualise to validate the sentiment analysis
+ apply the naive bayes sentiment analyser version of textblob 
+ identify and evaluate the differences between each approach

#### Each step below is given a description of what to do and some are accompanied by prompt images to confirm you are on the right track 

### Starter steps 
----
1. retrieve the data from this [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)
2. install texblob onto your conda environment
3. launch jupyter notebook in the same environment, and import pandas, matplotlib/seaborn and textblob 
4. read the data into a dataframe with pandas
5. filter the data frame to the relevant subset of columns shown in the below image 
7. using EDA /description statistics / simple charts, explore and familiarise yourself with the data at your own pace - clarify what each column means and what cleaning steps might be needed 
8.  

---- 

### Stretch guidance (optional follow on activities)
1. how accurate is the sentiment polarity on this data set? how could you tell ? 
2. what are the most useful ways to visualise the sentiment polarity against the other data? (hint: tableau or seaborn, for exploratory visualisation) 
3.

### When you are ready submit your lab via the student portal (github /google collab url)
